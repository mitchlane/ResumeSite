                        <p><b>Project Description:</b> "Have you ever wanted to take advantage of ambitious young dreamers looking to make a name for themselves in a fantasy setting? Well now you can! Buy beer! Buy food! Buy people! Take your mercenaries on a merry trip robbing merchants and fighting off bandits all in the name of profit. There is no better time than now to become a venture capitalist."

                            Mercenary Manager is a medieval-themed managerial game in which players
                            attempt to obtain and maintain as many resources, (food, beer, and 
                            mercenaries), as possible. It was developed in a team of six members over
                            a ten week period.
                            <br>
                            My responsibilities for the project included the impelemetation of the
                            HUD, collision detection algorithms, and development of game logic.

                            <p>One of my tasks for OpenVSP was to implement "negative volumes" for its
                               CFD mesh routine. The subroutine for determining if a triangle in the
                               mesh should be deleted or not was never designed for such functionalit,
                               so a large code refactor was needed. Along with negative volumes, I
                               included "transparent volumes," or objects that are not affected when
                               overlapping with another "positive volume, but should be deleted if
                               overlapping with a "negative volume."
                               <br><br>
                               The number of edge cases made finding a concise solution difficult.
                               For example, my algorithm had to know how to handle a negative volume
                               inside a negative volume inside a transparent volume inside a positive
                               volume. Fringe cases such as these made determining whether to delete
                               a mesh triangle or not difficult.

                          <p>
                            During my 2015 Summer vacation, my beautiful girlfriend requested that I
                            create a mobile application to assist in recording data of various
                            subjects performing a variety of tasks. She needed this data to
                            investigate whether or not gender and hand dominance impact automobile
                            operators' abilities to navigate a vehicle while interfacing with a
                            touchscreen.
                            <br><br>
                            The upper left image is the homescreen of the application.
                            Users select a task
                            to complete by taping on one of the three images.
                            <br><br>
                            The first task is shown in the upper right corner. On each tap on a
                            numbered box, the numbers are randomly to different boxes. When a user
                            was asked to complete this task, they were told to select a specific
                            number three times. When they complete the task, they hit the button
                            labeled "Done." Then, their time is recorded and they are returned to the
                            homescreen.
                            <br><br>
                            The bottom left image shows the drag task. Users were asked to drag the
                            grey circle along the slider until the number at the end of the silder
                            matched the number above the slider. Like the previous task, their time
                            was recorded.
                            <br><br>
                            I completed this task on my own time with no prior Android experience.

                               number of particles in a cube increase. The collision detection algorithm has a
                               complexity of O(n^2).

                               the programs computing 2,000 and 10,000 particles, but quite a large speedup
                               was found by offloading the 100,000 particle program.
